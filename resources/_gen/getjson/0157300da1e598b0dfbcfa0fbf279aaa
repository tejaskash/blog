{"title":"Pareto principle - Wikipedia","description":"The Pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity)[1][2] states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.[3] Management consultant Joseph M. Juran suggested the principle and named it after Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who noted the 80/20 connection while at the University of Lausanne in 1896, as published in his first work, Cours d'Ã©conomie politique. In it, Pareto showed that approximately 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population.","thumbnail_url":"","provider_name":"","provider_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org","author_name":""}
