### Me
I am a final year student at Manipal Institute Of Technology. My major is in
Information and Communication Technology with a minor in Artificial Intelligence.
I am currently scheduled to be a SDE Intern at Amazon, India in January 2021. I love working
on Web Applications, API's, and machine learning projects. You can view my  <mark style="background:lightblue;"> [resumé here](/docs/FinalCV.pdf).</mark><br/>

I am an avid reader. I love going on walks, listening to music, and learning European languages.

### Blog
I started this blog during the COVID-19 lockdown in April 2020. My aim is to make simple and
easy to follow articles and tutorials on a variety of topics like flask, machine learning and 
general developments in the tech industry.

This blog is built using <mark style="background:lightblue;">[Hugo](https://gohugo.io)</mark>, a static site generator. Credits for the theme 
go to <mark style="background:lightblue;">[rhazdon](https://github.com/rhazdon)</mark>. It is hosted on a Google Cloud VPC Instance running 
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, and uses <mark style="background:lightblue;">[NGINX](https://www.nginx.com)</mark> as the server.
